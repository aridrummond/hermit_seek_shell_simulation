## Hermit crab shell search simulator (Web App)
An interactive web-based simulation modeling hermit crab foraging behavior and shell selection strategies. Built with React and p5.js principles.

Developed with Claude.AI

# Version 1.81

## Features
- **Realistic foraging behavior**: Correlated random walk with chemotaxis (chemical gradient following)
- **Size-dependent shell selection**: Crabs seek optimal-fitting shells based on body size
- **Chemical cue detection**: Larger shells emit stronger signals, influencing search patterns
- **Memory system**: Adjustable memory (1-10) controls shell revisitation probability
- **Investigation timing**: 5-10 seconds based on shell fit quality
- **Visual feedback**: Color-coded shells (green=optimal, blue=too large, red=too small)
- **Data export**: Save simulation results to CSV with all parameters
- **Customizable parameters**: Crab size, shell quantity, spatial dispersion, memory
